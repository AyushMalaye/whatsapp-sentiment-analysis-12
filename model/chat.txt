— The _'Common'_ folder has books which are common for both semesters or useful in general irrespective of which semester it is.

— EVS ki kitaab nahin hai ismein; _Kaushik and Kaushik_ ka PDF online dhoondhoge toh mil jaayega.

— Bas maths ke liye Kumbhojkar leni padegi tumhein kisi se, baaki saare PDFs mil hi jaate hain online. Online resources bahot achhe hain, zaroor dekhna. 

Baaki segregate kiya hai jitna tha; dekh lo. 
Have fun. (Not sarcastic)

P. S. For when you want a break, there's one _non-academic_ folder as well. And no, it's not what you think xD

The campus drive for 2021 is in full swing, and tensions are high all over! Don't worry though, we're here to make the placement season slightly easier for you!😁

We present to you, *Placement Diaries, VJTI* - a splendid effort by _Shrushti Kale_ (BTech Production, who recently bagged an FTE offer from Citi). 

This is a blog containing the internship/placement experiences of the VJTI Batch of '21, contributed by students who have been placed in Goldman Sachs, Citi, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and many more! Think of it as your very own, VJTI's personal GeeksForGeeks!😉

*Link to the blog:* 
http://placementdiariesvjti.wordpress.com 

🔴 As of now, the blog is intended and targeted for VJTI students only, and is hence password protected (password: _vjti@123_). We humbly request you to circulate it amongst our college only. 

📌If you wish to contribute an article, or have any feedback or queries, please feel free to reach out to Shrushti (+91 88058 14441).

3. Once you login, read the rules carefully to start your exam.

4. This test has two parts – MCQ and Subjective. First you have to complete the MCQ section – since there are no negative marks, complete it by answering all questions. Once you submit this, you will be given a subjective paper link. Subjective paper is to be answered on blank pages (in your own handwriting and drawing) and then uploaded (clear photo or pdf) to your course classroom in designed assignment submission – ESEmock.

5. For your actual ESE (starting from Dec 1, 2020), you will be following similar process (MCQ in google forms submit and Subjective answer sheets uploaded on designated classroom of that subject within stipulated time period). It is to note that each one of you will be getting different question papers!!

She has asked not to panic if there are any problems regarding your login. 

Do not contact Sandip Sir as he has already conveyed all the issues which were reported to him, to the exam department. 

Regarding DD/MM  wala thing.. 
If you were logged in by using MM/DD Or DD/MM during the mock test, then continue that only for ESE. 
The college already has your data and your DOB won't be changed. 
In case by using both of methods you weren't able to login then you can write a mail to Mansi Kulkarni ma'am. 

The baseline is do not panic. Majority of the problems are being solved before the exam. If in case during exam you are facing login issues, the department will surely look into it. 

So stay calm.

15/12/2020, 2:11 pm - +91 99305 88266: Dear all, 

There will be a discussion session for subjective paper. 

Do not ask/join, if the mistake is from your end. First, go through the solution done by you and verify it with the solution key. Read the comments given by me. If still, you feel there is a mistake in marking, then you can contact me during the session. This will save my and your time. 

Marks is given based on total calculations. So do not compare with others. The comment might be same but marks will differ, as it depends upon how much calculation you have done. 

*Student can ask question one by one as per the list.*

*There will be 1 hour doubt session on Thursday. So, if you join after the mentioned time then, I will not attend you. (Plz note)*

I will inform you of an exact time tomorrow for doubt session.  

*I will share google form where you have to mention in advance if there is any correction or not. So, the time slot will arrange accordingly.*

If yes, then mention *YES*
If no correction, then mention *NO*

*Note: this query is only for the subjective part.*

*Students are requested not to send any message(such as WhatsApp, normal message or email) for now.*

*Those who forget to upload question paper or submitted after 5 minutes they will get some penalty.*

"जर का भविष्यात एखादा विद्यार्थी / विद्यार्थिनी शिष्यवृत्ती योजनेपासून वंचित राहिल्यास तसेच त्याचे आर्थिक नुकसान झाल्यास याची सर्वस्वी जवाबदारी विद्यार्थी / विद्यार्थिनी ची असेल याची गांभीर्याने नोंद घ्यावी."

24/03/2021, 2:09 pm - +91 99305 88266: Hello Sir/Ma'am,

Thanks for all the support we have received from the professors’
community. It’s really overwhelming, we are already helping over 300k+
students per month and have launched more programming courses for free
to help students.

As a quick introduction, we are alumni of IIT(P) who started CodesDope
(https://www.codesdope.com) back in 2016 to make learning to code as
simple as possible by providing the easiest yet most effective
tutorials for free. Our mission is a very humble and simple one; to
make learning so uncomplicated that even those who have absolutely no
background in the field of coding can learn it in a reasonably small
time-period.

We have recently launched courses in Python, C++, Data Structures and
Algorithms. We have tried our best to make these tutorials as simple
as they were possible.

We are sure that your students would love the engaging content of our
website, and it would greatly help them in improving their programming
skills. We will be so very grateful to you if you could share the
courses among your mentees.

Thanks,
Shivam Sutrakar

What I understood is that once you select the template, you have to modify it based on your requirements (here we are assuming that the template you've gotten online doesn't meet all your requirements and hence addition/deletion is required)

And in the video you can show what template you started with and what you finally got after making a few modifications
23/08/2021, 9:33 pm - +91 99305 88266: These are not 2, its 1 only, I made it two different task out if it.

1. Only selection if theme, exporting to your machine, hosting on local   host and presenting that your requirements matches there.
*This you might have already done, we had discussed this assignment already and I told u to do this before I post*

2. This us for customization of theme, here u need to work on HTML, CSS and to some extend JS.

In India, all children like Navratri.
Everyone who likes Navratri likes any tiger.
Shera is a tiger and has gorgeous bold stripes on the body.
Anything which has a gorgeous bold stripe is weird or is a comedian. 
No tiger is a comedian.
Weird things are not liked by Ajay.

19/04/2022, 7:44 pm - +91 99305 88266: We tried every possible way to avoid this but the authorities are still not convinced or maybe they aren't believing the reasons that CRs gave to them. So now the solution to this problem lies in the hands of students. If you have any issues regarding the mode of examination, then you should convey your issue to Dean AP via email on dean_ap@vjti.ac.in keeping CS IT HOD( hod_degree@ce.vjti.ac.in) in CC.
19/04/2022, 7:57 pm - +91 99305 88266: Emailing to Dean or HOD will be your own responsibility.
19/04/2022, 11:28 pm - +91 99305 88266: Be ready for GD tomorrow at 9 AM

20/04/2022, 4:15 pm - +91 99305 88266: We discussed all the concerns from our students with the Dean (Sangle Sir). There are few other things which we have to consider. 
1] As our college is autonomous, there is autonomous period and after that period ends, UGC comes to college and takes the decision to extend the autonomous period.
2] So as of now, Mumbai University has given the notice to conduct the examination in offline mode, and we also have the authority to disobey that notice and conduct the examination in online mode on departmental level. But this have few severe consequences.
     a. If UGC comes to college and asks about, why we disobeyed the notice issued by the University, then only HoD and students are liable to answer and further actions will be taken.
    b. They might ask for re-examination or may deny to give our degree. So, it's possible to conduct online exams but on our own risks.

3] We also said that students are getting panic after receiving the offline exam notice and 3:45 mins examination.
On this concern, sir said that, don't worry about it, we'll take decision to make the examination of 60 marks and of 2:30 mins.
And as students are getting panicked, we'll ask faculties to consider few things like making question paper relatively easy and less lengthy as compared to the online examination.

4] Exams will be on alternative days, and talking about the lab exams for the students who are going to join their internships during exam periods, they can request HoD to take their labs before the ESE (labs are offline too).
And also, if you are having internship of more than 2 months, your attendance will be considered in next sem, so don't worry about it.
You may also mail respective companies to extend the joining date for the internship.
20/04/2022, 4:18 pm - +91 99305 88266: So the final outcome of all this discussion is that exam will be held in offline mode for SY, TY and final year students.

PC LAB EXAM WILL BE ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY BOTH FROM 9 AM TO 5 PM. So now the actual PC slot is Monday 2 to 5 PM, but if you are done with DIP on Monday before 12 PM, you can go and give the PC lab exam and I will pass on a sheet that day which you will fill after giving any lab exam. The same thing will be done on Tuesday whenever you are free between 9 and 5. You have to go and give your PC lab exam and its your responsibility. *Plus in the actual PC slot, only 40 students can accommodate that is the first 40 students of our class(I will send the list). So these 40 students shouldn't go before 2 PM AT ANY COST and also other than these 40 students, no one should go for PC LAB EXAM at 2 PM at any cost.* If you do so, it will just create a mess for CRs and then we will have to face consequences by Shirole sir. So the other 40 students should try their best and go for PC lab exam as soon as their dip viva is finished.

Subject: AICTE - Request to encourage your student and faculty to register for Digital Skilling Initiative – inaugurated by Hon’ble Minister of Education, Sh. Dharmendra Pradhan Ji - Reg.
To: <rnawale@el.vjti.ac.in>


Dear Sir/Mam, 
Greetings from the All India Council of Technical Education, Ministry of Education (GoI).

As you are aware the Launch ceremony of digital skilling initiatives (https://1crore.aicte-india.org/) in emerging and future technologies for skilling, reskilling, upskilling, internship, apprenticeship, and employment to one crore students was held on 6th June 2022. Hon’ble Minister of Education,  Sh. Dharmendra Pradhan and Hon’ble Minister of State, Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship Sh. Rajeev Chandrasekhar launched the event.

Under the "Make in India '' initiative, and performance incentive link schemes India has received 385 billion USD investment in the last 8 years which means India is going to be a global manufacturing hub. Empowering 4 crore higher education students and recent graduates to access industry-aligned courses for skilling and upskilling is key for Aatmanirbhar Bharat. Continuous upskilling is the driving force for making India the global digital talent hub. 

With a vision to make our country “India as Technology Capital of the World” we would like to initiate a campaign “Technology for every Indian student” which aims to Evaluate -> Train -> Practice -> Internship -> Perform -> Certify -> Employ 

It is envisioned to register more than 1 crore students/faculty and get them trained in the emerging areas for 3 to 6 months. The student/faculty can avail this benefit by registering on the portal: https://1crore.aicte-india.org/

          We hereby share the user manual in the form of a YouTube video. Students/Faculty can watch the below-given video and register themselves:

For current Students:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VABSLhdxa4&t=5s

For passout Students/recent graduates/Faculty:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnMR4O4zuRU

We request you to circulate this information among the student/faculty of your institute and ask them to register for digital skilling in various emerging technologies.  

For any other clarifications, feel free to contact us.

regards,
Buddha Chandrasekhar

You will receive video lectures for these courses and will take the same exam as SMU students.
SMU faculty will grade your paper on a 4-point scale, which will be converted to a 10-point scale.

Both courses are master's level courses, so if you apply for a master's degree at SMU (a second-tier college), you can use the credits for your Master's course that you earned this semester for that subject.

*Both courses are free of cost.*
